<h2 id="doc-license">License</h2>

<p>The freia library is distributed using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD 2-clause license</a>.
You can find the license text in the <a href="/license.txt">license.txt</a>
file. The BSD 2-clause license allows you to use freia for both open source and
commercial projects with little to no restrictions; mainly you just need to
maintain the license text in the files, even if you make modifications to the
files in question.</p>
