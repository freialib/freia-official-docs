<p>The <a href="https://github.com/freialib">freia library</a>
is a tome of php server magic that you can add to any project, be it an exotic
blank page, that awesome box of horrors you unwillingly inherited from your dev
grandma' (which you're too scared to touch), even that web framework that's the
fastest "hello world" claptrap of the month.</p>

<p class="doc-Note">Unlike other solutions even if you don't pick freia to
start a project, or don't pick freia for your main logic, we've designed freia
to be a solution you can always goto. It's never too late to use
freia.</small></p>

<p>Among the solutions we provide in the main modules, you'll find easy routing
though <code class="code code-class">HttpDispatcher</code></b>, programatic
security and access control via <code class="code code-class">Auth</code> and
protocols, an easy to use cli system via
<code class="code code-class">Console</code>, flexible migration system via
the <code class="code code-class">pdx</code> command, and much more...

<p>The code is clean and easy to read, verifiable, self contained and
replacable.</p>

<p>The project is <a href="https://github.com/freialib">hosted on GitHub</a>.

<p><i><b>The freia library is currently still in early development</b>.
Version v0.1 is available if you wish to take a look at it; it's
production usable, just need to know what you're doing. The major parts
of the code is based on tools that have been used in production.</i></p>

<p><i>Documentation is complete at this time. Version 1.0 won't have
any re-design changes, just test coverage, test tools, etc; design changes
required by tests will happen if absolutely necesary. Documentation that refers
to "dev-master" as dependencies will be switched to "1.0" and stability
"stable" with the advent of v1.0</i></p>
